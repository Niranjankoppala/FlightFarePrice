# Peformed Tasks:
1. Importing Dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. HandlingCategorical Data
4. Feature Selection
5. Using Random Forest Regressor
6. Performing Hyper Parametric Tuning to increse the accuracy

# Aim:
To predict the price of a flight ticket from source to destination on a particular day based on number of stops

# Procedure
1. written all the mahine learning code in jupiter notebook and generated pickel file
2. create a web page using HTML and css
3. connect these pickel file and web pages to a python file using Flask
4. run this file in anacnda prompt using ommand python filename.py 
# Used Agorithms 
Used RandomForestRegressor Which gives Accuracy of 81% after Performing HyperParametric Tuning
